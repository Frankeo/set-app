# Kudos

This project was inspired by [Brian Holt](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/) and one the courses that he created for [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

The **examples** are based and constructed according to some tips and, of course, the class project shared on it.
The course project is used for default [React](https://stupendous-meerkat-980ca8.netlify.app) and [React-Redux](https://jocular-kringle-b9193b.netlify.app) projects.

So, thank you so much for this!!
